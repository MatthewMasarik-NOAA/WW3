WAVEWATCH III<sup>&reg;</sup> is a community wave modeling
framework that includes the latest scientific advancements in the
field of wind-wave modeling and dynamics. The core of the framework
consist of the WAVEWATCH III<sup>&reg;</sup> third generation wave
model (<b>WAVE</b>-height, <b>WAT</b>er depth and <b>C</b>urrent
<b>H</b>indcasting) and is developed at NOAA/NCEP.
